# To-Do-List

Created a to-do-list webservice. Contains 7 columns, 1 column contains each day of the week. The user can click "add Task" to open a modal which allows them to select multiple days of the week and the task they want to assign. After creating a task, the task will stay even after refreshing until it is deleted by clicking the checkmark next to task and selecting the "delete task" button. 

*NOTE* this was my first project dealing with html, css, and javascript
